## Usage

Create a Carafe instance, add dependencies to it, and get them back out where needed.

```js
// provider.mjs
import Carafe from 'carafe'
const container = new Carafe();
container.add('water', () => 'fresh and cool');
export default container;

// elsewhere.mjs
import container from 'provider.mjs';
const water = container.get('water');
return water(); // fresh and cool

// in your tests...
import container from 'provider.mjs';
import elsewhere from 'elsewhere.mjs';
container.replace('water', () => 'mock water');
elsewhere(); // mock water
container.restore('water'); // or to restore all mocks, use restore()
elsewhere(); // fresh and cool
```

## Methods

Carafe instances should be `new`ed up, and the instance returns will have the following methods. You can call Carafe() as well, and it will return a new instance for you.

### add(name, payload)

Registered a new dependency by name. `name` should be a string, and the method will throw if it's not.

### get(name)

Returns a registered dependency by name. If there is no matching depdendency, the method will throw.

### inject(dependencies[], function)

Takes an array of named depdendencies, passing them in order as arguments to `function`. Returns whatever `function` returns. 

**NOTE:** Dependencies are only injected at call time, so using `replace` with this syntax isn't useful as the values won't be re-read and replaced with the alternate payload.

### replace(name, payload)

Used to replace a dependency's value in a recoverable way. `replace` can be called multiple times, and the resulting value when `get` is used will always be whatever the last value provided was. Use `restore` to restore the original dependency's payload.

### restore([name])

Used to restore a given dependency to its original registered value, undoing any `replace` calls. If no name is provided, *all* dependencies are restored.
